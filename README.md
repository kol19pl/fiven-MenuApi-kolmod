# MenuAPI
FiveM C# Menu API. 

Designed specifically as a replacement of NativeUI for vMenu with improved performance (somewhat), more features, less bugs, and easier to use functions (somewhat).

Full safezone scaling supported, both left and right aligned menus supported.

This has been coded from the ground up. Using GTA V Decompiled scripts to figure out what some undocumented natives were used for.

It's very simple, don't steal my stuff and try to take credit. That's all I ask.

If you feel like it you can link it just because you're nice, but there's no need to do this. I'd appreciate it if you just put the link to this repo somewhere in your credits/readme file. :)
